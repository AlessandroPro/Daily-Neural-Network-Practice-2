Train [Compositional Pattern Producing Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network) as a Generative Model, using Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoder techniques to produce high resolution images.

Run `python train.py` from the command line to train from scratch and experiment with different settings.

`sampler.py` can be used inside IPython to interactively see results from the models being trained.

See my blog post at [blog.otoro.net](http://blog.otoro.net/2016/04/01/generating-large-images-from-latent-vectors/) for more details.

I tested the implementation on TensorFlow 0.60.
